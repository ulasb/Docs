# **The History of Cyprus: A Journey from Antiquity to Partition**

Cyprus is the third-largest island in the Mediterranean. Its history is defined by its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, leading to millennia of conquest and a deeply complex modern political landscape.

**1\. Ancient Crossroads (10,000 BCE – 1191 CE)**

Cyprus was a prize for every major power in the Mediterranean due to its abundant copper resources and proximity to trade routes.

* **Greek Influence:** Around 1200 BCE, Mycenaean Greeks settled on the island, establishing the Greek language and culture that remain central to the majority population today.  
* **Successive Empires:** The island was subsequently ruled by the Assyrians, Egyptians, Persians, and eventually [Alexander the Great](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.britannica.com/place/Cyprus/Ancient-history).  
* **Roman & Byzantine Rule:** Cyprus became a Roman province in 58 BCE. After the division of the Roman Empire, it spent eight centuries as part of the Greek-speaking **Byzantine Empire**, which solidified the role of the Orthodox Church.

**2\. Medieval and Ottoman Eras (1191 – 1878\)**

The Crusades brought Western European influence to the island before it was absorbed by the East.

* **The Lusignans & Venetians:** After Richard the Lionheart captured Cyprus during the Third Crusade, it was ruled by the French Lusignan dynasty and later the Republic of Venice.  
* **Ottoman Conquest (1571):** The Ottoman Empire seized the island from Venice. This period saw the introduction of a permanent Turkish population, forming the basis of the modern **Turkish Cypriot** community.  
* **The Millet System:** The Ottomans allowed the Greek Orthodox Church to manage the affairs of the Greek population, preserving their distinct identity but also creating a communal divide.

**3\. British Administration (1878 – 1960\)**

As the Ottoman Empire declined, Britain took control of Cyprus to protect its sea routes to India.

* **Colonial Status:** Britain formally annexed Cyprus in 1914 and made it a Crown Colony in 1925\.  
* **Conflicting Aspirations:**  
  * **Enosis:** The Greek Cypriot movement for union with Greece.  
  * **Taksim:** The Turkish Cypriot counter-movement for partition or union with Turkey.  
* **EOKA Struggle:** In 1955, a Greek Cypriot guerrilla group (EOKA) began an armed campaign against British rule to achieve *Enosis*.

**4\. Independence and Intercommunal Conflict (1960 – 1974\)**

Cyprus gained independence in 1960, but the new Republic was fragile from the start.

* **The 1960 Constitution:** A power-sharing agreement was established between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, with Britain, Greece, and Turkey acting as "Guarantor Powers."  
* **Collapse of Cooperation:** By 1963, the government reached a deadlock. Violent [intercommunal clashes](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://mfa.gov.cy/the-cyprus-question.html) broke out, leading to the deployment of UN Peacekeeping forces (UNFICYP) in 1964—a presence that remains today.

**5\. 1974: The Turning Point**

The modern division of Cyprus is the direct result of two weeks of upheaval in the summer of 1974\.

1. **The Coup:** On July 15, 1974, the military junta ruling Greece backed a coup in Cyprus to overthrow President Makarios III and achieve *Enosis*.  
2. **The Invasion:** On July 20, 1974, Turkey launched a military invasion, citing its right as a Guarantor Power to protect the Turkish Cypriot minority.  
3. **Displacement:** The conflict resulted in the displacement of approximately 160,000 Greek Cypriots to the south and 45,000 Turkish Cypriots to the north.

**6\. Cyprus Today: A Divided Island**

Since 1974, the island has remained physically and politically split by a UN-patrolled **"Green Line."**

| Entity | Description | Recognition |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Republic of Cyprus (ROC)** | Controls the southern 60% of the island. Predominantly Greek Cypriot. | Internationally recognized as the sole sovereign authority; joined the **EU in 2004**. |
| **Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC)** | Controls the northern 36% of the island. Predominantly Turkish Cypriot. | Recognized **only by Turkey**. Considered occupied territory by the UN. |
| **The Buffer Zone** | A demilitarized zone managed by the UN. | N/A |

### **Current Status**

* **The "Cyprus Problem":** Numerous UN-led negotiations (most notably the [2004 Annan Plan](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/speeches/2004-03-31/remarks-conclusion-cyprus-talks)) have failed to reunify the island.  
* **Normalization:** Since 2003, several checkpoints have opened, allowing residents to cross the Green Line for the first time in decades, though political resolution remains elusive.
