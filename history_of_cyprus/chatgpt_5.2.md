# A Concise History of Cyprus

## Why Cyprus Matters

Cyprus sits at the eastern edge of the Mediterranean, near Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. Its location made it strategically valuable for trade, military control, and cultural exchange. That geography largely explains the island’s long history of foreign rule and, ultimately, its modern political division.

## Antiquity: Early Civilizations to Rome

Human settlement on Cyprus dates back over 10,000 years. By the Bronze Age, the island was a major producer of copper (the English word *copper* derives from *Kyprios*, meaning “from Cyprus”).

Cyprus came under the influence or control of several powers, including the Mycenaeans, Assyrians, Egyptians, and Persians. In 333 BCE, Alexander the Great conquered the island, integrating it into the Hellenistic world. Greek language and culture became dominant and remain foundational to Greek Cypriot identity today.

After Alexander’s death, Cyprus was ruled by the Ptolemies of Egypt, and in 58 BCE it was annexed by Rome. Under Roman and later Byzantine rule, Christianity spread widely; Cyprus is traditionally associated with the missionary journeys of Paul the Apostle and Barnabas.

## Medieval Period: From Byzantium to the Ottomans

Following the division of the Roman Empire, Cyprus remained part of the Byzantine Empire for centuries. In 1191, during the Third Crusade, Richard the Lionheart captured the island. Cyprus then passed to the French Lusignan dynasty, becoming a feudal kingdom.

In 1489, control transferred to the Republic of Venice, which valued Cyprus as a defensive outpost against Ottoman expansion. Despite extensive fortifications, the Ottomans conquered Cyprus in 1571. Ottoman rule lasted over 300 years. During this period, the population became religiously divided: most Greek Cypriots were Orthodox Christians, while Turkish Cypriots were Muslims. This religious distinction later hardened into ethnic and political identities. See: [https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/otha/hd_otha.htm](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/otha/hd_otha.htm)

## British Rule and the Rise of Nationalism (1878–1960)

In 1878, the Ottoman Empire transferred administrative control of Cyprus to Britain. The island was formally annexed by the United Kingdom in 1914 and became a Crown Colony in 1925.

Under British rule, competing nationalist movements intensified. Many Greek Cypriots sought *enosis*—union with Greece—while Turkish Cypriots increasingly favored either continued British rule or *taksim*, the partition of the island. These opposing goals set the stage for future conflict.

In the 1950s, the Greek Cypriot guerrilla group EOKA launched an armed campaign against British rule. Violence escalated between Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. Britain, Greece, and Turkey eventually negotiated a compromise solution.

## Independence and Breakdown (1960–1974)

Cyprus became an independent republic in 1960. Its constitution attempted to balance power between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, with guaranteed roles for both communities. The United Kingdom, Greece, and Turkey became guarantor powers of the new state.

The system proved fragile. Disputes over governance led to intercommunal violence in 1963–64, causing Turkish Cypriots to withdraw from central government and retreat into enclaves. United Nations peacekeepers were deployed in 1964 and remain on the island today. See: [https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/mission/unficyp](https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/mission/unficyp)

## 1974: Coup, Invasion, and Division

In July 1974, a coup backed by Greece’s military junta sought to overthrow the Cypriot government and achieve *enosis*. In response, Turkey invaded Cyprus, citing its role as a guarantor power and the need to protect Turkish Cypriots.

Turkish forces eventually controlled about 37% of the island’s territory in the north. Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced: Greek Cypriots fled south, and Turkish Cypriots moved north. The island has remained effectively divided since then by a UN-patrolled buffer zone known as the Green Line.

## The Modern Situation

In 1983, the Turkish-controlled north declared itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). It is recognized only by Turkey. The Republic of Cyprus continues to be internationally recognized as the sole legitimate government of the island.

In 2004, the Republic of Cyprus joined the European Union. EU law is suspended in the northern part of the island. Numerous UN-led efforts to reunify Cyprus have failed, including the Annan Plan, which was accepted by Turkish Cypriots but rejected by Greek Cypriots in a referendum.

## Where Things Stand Today

Cyprus remains divided along political, ethnic, and historical lines shaped by centuries of external rule and 20th-century nationalism. While violence has largely ceased, the core disputes over security, governance, property, and sovereignty remain unresolved. Understanding this layered history is essential to understanding why the Cyprus issue has proven so difficult to solve.
