# **The History of Cyprus: A Journey Through Division**

Cyprus is an island nation in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, located south of Turkey and west of Syria. Its history is defined by its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, leading to centuries of conquest and a modern-day division that persists today.

**1\. Ancient and Medieval Foundations**

Cyprus has been inhabited for over 10,000 years. Its identity was heavily influenced by [Mycenaean Greeks](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.britannica.com/place/Cyprus/Ancient-Cyprus) who settled the island in the 2nd millennium BCE, establishing the Greek language and culture as dominant. Over the centuries, the island was ruled by various empires, including the Assyrians, Egyptians, Persians, Romans, and Byzantines.

In 1191, during the Third Crusade, [Richard the Lionheart](https://www.worldhistory.org/Richard_I_of_England/) conquered the island. It was later sold to the Lusignans, a French noble family, and eventually fell under the control of the Republic of Venice in 1489\.

## **2\. Ottoman Rule (1571–1878)**

The Ottoman Empire conquered Cyprus in 1571\. This period introduced a significant [Turkish population](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://mfa.gov.ct.tr/cyprus-history/ottoman-period/) to the island, alongside the existing Greek Orthodox population. The Ottomans established the "millet" system, which allowed religious communities to govern their own internal affairs, a structure that reinforced distinct ethnic identities rather than a unified "Cypriot" identity.

## **3\. British Administration (1878–1960)**

In 1878, the Ottoman Empire leased the administration of Cyprus to Great Britain in exchange for protection against Russian expansion. Britain formally annexed the island in 1914 at the start of World War I and made it a [Crown Colony in 1925](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/cyprus-under-british-rule-1878-1960/).

During this time, two opposing political movements gained momentum:

* **Enosis:** The movement among Greek Cypriots for political union with Greece.  
* **Taksim:** The movement among Turkish Cypriots for the partition of the island.

In the 1950s, the [EOKA](https://www.britannica.com/topic/EOKA) (National Organization of Cypriot Fighters) began a guerrilla campaign against British rule to achieve Enosis.

## **4\. Independence and Intercommunal Conflict (1960–1974)**

Cyprus gained independence from Britain in 1960\. The new Republic's constitution was a complex power-sharing agreement between the Greek Cypriot majority (approx. 80%) and the Turkish Cypriot minority (approx. 18%).

The system proved fragile. In 1963, the government collapsed following disputes over constitutional amendments. This led to widespread [intercommunal violence](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://unficyp.unmissions.org/history-unficyp), forcing many Turkish Cypriots into enclaves. In 1964, the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) was deployed to maintain order.

## **5\. 1974: Coup and Turkish Intervention**

The most pivotal year in modern Cypriot history is 1974\.

1. **July 15:** The military junta ruling Greece backed a [coup d'état](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17217956) in Cyprus to overthrow President Makarios III and declare union with Greece.  
2. **July 20:** Citing its role as a "guarantor power" under the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee, Turkey launched a military invasion to protect Turkish Cypriots.

The conflict resulted in the displacement of approximately 160,000 Greek Cypriots to the south and 45,000 Turkish Cypriots to the north.

## **6\. The Divided Island Today**

Since 1974, the island has been physically divided by a 112-mile UN-monitored "Green Line" buffer zone.

| Feature | Republic of Cyprus (South) | Northern Cyprus (TRNC) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Status** | Internationally recognized government. | Recognized only by Turkey. |
| **Population** | Primarily Greek Cypriot. | Primarily Turkish Cypriot/Turkish. |
| **EU Status** | Member of the [European Union](https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles/cyprus_en) since 2004\. | Technically EU territory, but EU law is suspended. |
| **Currency** | Euro (€) | Turkish Lira (₺) |

### **Current Stalemate**

In 1983, the northern part of the island declared itself the [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC)](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/cyprus-divided-island), a move condemned by the UN Security Council. Numerous peace talks, including the 2004 [Annan Plan](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/apr/25/cyprus.helenasmith), have failed to reunify the island.

Today, while tensions have cooled and several crossing points have opened along the Green Line, the fundamental political dispute remains unresolved, leaving Cyprus a divided nation in a strategically sensitive region.
