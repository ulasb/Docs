# The History of Cyprus: From Ancient Times to Division

## Introduction

Cyprus is a Mediterranean island located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Its strategic position has made it a prize for empires throughout history, and today it remains divided—the only split capital in Europe. Understanding Cyprus requires tracing its path from ancient civilizations through foreign occupations to its present-day partition.

## Ancient Cyprus: Copper and Civilizations

[Human settlement in Cyprus dates back approximately 12,000 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Cyprus), with the first known permanent settlement at Khirokitia appearing around 9,000 years ago. [These early inhabitants lived in well-constructed two-story round stone houses](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cyprus/History), demonstrating sophisticated architectural skills for the Neolithic period.

The island's name itself derives from its most valuable resource: [the ancient word "kypros" meaning copper](https://cyprusconferences.org/cyprus-history/). This metal wealth attracted traders and conquerors alike. [During the Bronze Age (1600-1050 BCE), systematic copper mining began](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Cyprus), establishing Cyprus as a major trading hub in the eastern Mediterranean.

[Mycenaean Greeks arrived in large numbers during the Late Bronze Age](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/cyprus-ancient-world), bringing Greek language and culture that would profoundly shape the island's identity. [Following the Bronze Age collapse around 1050 BCE, Greek settlers founded city-kingdoms](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cyprus/History) including Salamis, Paphos, and Kourion, establishing Cyprus as fundamentally Greek in character.

## The Age of Empires

Cyprus's strategic location made it irresistible to regional powers. [The Assyrians dominated from the 8th century BCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history_of_Cyprus), followed by brief Egyptian control, then Persian rule. [Alexander the Great's conquest in 333 BCE accelerated Hellenization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history_of_Cyprus), though Phoenician influence remained through their colony at Citium (modern Larnaca).

[After Alexander's death, Cyprus fell under Ptolemaic Egyptian rule until 58 BCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history_of_Cyprus), when it became a Roman province. The Roman period brought relative peace and prosperity for three centuries, during which Cyprus became significant in early Christianity—[it was the first Roman province governed by a Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history_of_Cyprus).

Following the division of the Roman Empire, [Cyprus became part of the Byzantine Empire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cyprus/History), remaining predominantly Greek and Orthodox Christian. This Byzantine period lasted until 1191, when [Richard the Lionheart conquered Cyprus during the Third Crusade](https://fcaousa.org/about-cyprus/history-of-cyprus/).

## Medieval Transitions: Crusaders to Ottomans

[The Lusignan dynasty established a Frankish kingdom in 1192](https://fcaousa.org/about-cyprus/history-of-cyprus/), introducing Western European feudalism and Catholic Christianity alongside the established Orthodox Church. [In 1489, the Republic of Venice took control](https://fcaousa.org/about-cyprus/history-of-cyprus/), fortifying cities like Nicosia and Famagusta against the expanding Ottoman threat.

[These fortifications proved insufficient. In 1570, Ottoman forces invaded with 60,000-100,000 soldiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Cyprus). [Nicosia fell quickly, and Famagusta surrendered in 1571 after a prolonged siege](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cyprus/Ottoman-rule), beginning over three centuries of Ottoman rule.

## Ottoman Rule (1571-1878)

[Ottoman administration abolished feudal tenure and granted Greek peasants hereditary land rights](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cyprus/Ottoman-rule). The Ottomans applied their [millet system, which allowed religious communities self-governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Cyprus), reinforcing the Orthodox Church's role as the ethnarch—ethnic leader—of the Greek Cypriot population.

[Thousands of Muslims settled Cyprus following the conquest](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cyprus/Ottoman-rule), establishing the Turkish Cypriot community. However, [Greek Cypriots remained the majority throughout Ottoman rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EOKA), comprising approximately 80% of the population.

[In 1821, suspecting Greek Cypriot sympathy with the Greek War of Independence, Ottoman authorities executed the Orthodox archbishop and hundreds of Greek Cypriots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Cyprus). This brutal suppression deepened Greek Cypriot desire for eventual union with Greece—a goal called *enosis*.

## British Colonial Period (1878-1960)

[Following Russia's defeat of the Ottoman Empire in 1878, Britain took administrative control of Cyprus through the Cyprus Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Cyprus), though Ottoman sovereignty technically continued. [When the Ottoman Empire joined World War I against Britain, Cyprus was formally annexed in 1914](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Cyprus). [Turkey recognized British sovereignty in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Cyprus_(1878%E2%80%93present)), and [Cyprus became a Crown Colony in 1925](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Cyprus).

British rule brought infrastructure development—roads, bridges, water systems—but also high taxation and limited political representation. [Greek Cypriots expected British administration would lead to union with Greece](whatson-northcyprus.com/history/british.htm), and when this didn't materialize, frustration mounted.

[Turkish Cypriots opposed enosis, fearing persecution based on the fate of Turkish minorities in former Ottoman territories that had joined Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EOKA). They increasingly called for *taksim* (partition), seeking to divide Cyprus between Greek and Turkish sectors.

## The Road to Violence

[In 1955, Colonel George Grivas founded EOKA (National Organization of Cypriot Fighters)](https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/what-caused-the-division-of-the-island-of-cyprus), launching an armed campaign for enosis with support from Archbishop Makarios III. [EOKA targeted British colonial authorities, police, and military personnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EOKA), using bombings and assassinations.

[In response, Turkish Cypriots formed TMT (Turkish Resistance Organization)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EOKA) to counter EOKA and promote partition. [EOKA strategically targeted Turkish Cypriot policemen to provoke intercommunal violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_intercommunal_violence), forcing British troops from the mountains into cities to maintain order. This tactical decision ignited ethnic tensions that would prove catastrophic.

[British censuses consistently showed Greek Cypriots comprised approximately 77-80% of the population, with Turkish Cypriots around 18%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EOKA). The communities were religiously and linguistically distinct, and increasingly politically polarized.

## Independence and Constitutional Crisis

[Unable to suppress EOKA, Britain negotiated the Zurich and London Agreements of February 1959](http://whatson-northcyprus.com/history/british.htm). [Cyprus became independent on August 16, 1960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_intercommunal_violence), with a complex constitution designed to protect both communities.

The 1960 constitution established:
- A Greek Cypriot president and Turkish Cypriot vice-president, each with veto power
- A 70:30 ratio for Greek to Turkish Cypriots in government positions
- Separate municipalities for the two communities
- Treaties guaranteeing independence and prohibiting both enosis and taksim
- [Britain, Greece, and Turkey as guarantor powers with intervention rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_problem)

[Neither community was satisfied—Greek Cypriots had not achieved enosis, while Turkish Cypriots feared majority rule](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/cyprus-crisis-erupts). [Archbishop Makarios became the first president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Cyprus), but the constitutional arrangements proved unworkable.

## Intercommunal Violence (1963-1974)

[In 1963, Makarios proposed constitutional amendments that Turkish Cypriots viewed as eliminating their protections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus). [On December 21, 1963—"Bloody Christmas"—intercommunal violence erupted when two Turkish Cypriots were killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_intercommunal_violence). The constitutional order collapsed as Turkish Cypriots withdrew from government.

[Fighting spread across the island. By 1964, hundreds had died, and UN peacekeeping forces (UNFICYP) deployed to maintain cease-fire lines](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76v30/d73), including one dividing Nicosia. [Turkish Cypriots increasingly lived in enclaves, while Greek Cypriot paramilitaries committed atrocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_intercommunal_violence).

[In 1967, another outbreak of violence nearly triggered Turkish invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_problem). Greece was forced to recall General Grivas and reduce troop levels. [Turkish Cypriots declared a provisional administration in December 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_problem), which Makarios declared illegal.

Meanwhile, [a military junta had seized power in Greece in 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_problem). The colonels supported radical Greek Cypriot nationalists who formed EOKA-B, viewing Makarios as too moderate on enosis.

## The 1974 Crisis: Coup and Invasion

[On July 15, 1974, the Greek junta orchestrated a coup against Makarios](https://www.euronews.com/2025/07/20/cyprus-marks-51-years-since-turkish-invasion-that-led-to-island-nations-partition), using the Cypriot National Guard and EOKA-B forces. [They installed Nikos Sampson, an extremist who had killed British personnel and Turkish Cypriots during the 1950s, as provisional president](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/cyprus-crisis-erupts). Makarios escaped and fled to Britain, from where he denounced the coup at the UN.

[Turkey invoked its rights under the Treaty of Guarantee and invaded on July 20, 1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus). Turkish forces landed at Kyrenia, deploying paratroopers and conducting aerial bombardment. [The invasion had two phases: the initial operation in July captured 3% of the island, then after failed negotiations, a second offensive in August secured 36-38% of Cyprus's territory](https://www.euronews.com/2025/07/20/cyprus-marks-51-years-since-turkish-invasion-that-led-to-island-nations-partition).

The crisis had devastating human consequences:
- [Over 3,000 people died, mostly civilians](https://www.euronews.com/2025/07/20/cyprus-marks-51-years-since-turkish-invasion-that-led-to-island-nations-partition)
- [Approximately 162,000-200,000 Greek Cypriots fled or were expelled from the north](https://www.gov.cy/mfa/en/documents/turkish-military-invasion-and-occupation/)
- [About 60,000 Turkish Cypriots were displaced from the south](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus)
- [Over 2,000 people remain missing from events in 1963-1974](https://www.euronews.com/2025/07/20/cyprus-marks-51-years-since-turkish-invasion-that-led-to-island-nations-partition)

[Both sides committed atrocities. Greek Cypriot forces massacred over 100 Turkish Cypriots in the villages of Maratha, Santalaris, and Aloda](https://www.euronews.com/2025/07/20/cyprus-marks-51-years-since-turkish-invasion-that-led-to-island-nations-partition). Turkish forces and irregulars killed Greek Cypriot civilians and prisoners.

## The Divided Island Today

[The August 1974 ceasefire line became the UN Buffer Zone, commonly called the Green Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus). This 180-kilometer barrier runs the length of the island, cutting through the capital Nicosia—making it [the last divided capital in Europe](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=48c6f008-d2bf-4ec0-8933-c4e3e2d4850e).

[In 1983, Turkish Cypriots declared the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus). [This state is recognized only by Turkey and condemned as illegal by UN Security Council resolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus). Turkey maintains approximately 30,000 troops in the north.

The Republic of Cyprus—the internationally recognized government controlling the south—[joined the European Union in 2004](https://www.euronews.com/2025/07/20/cyprus-marks-51-years-since-turkish-invasion-that-led-to-island-nations-partition), though EU law does not apply in the north. This makes [Cyprus the only EU member state under military occupation](https://www.euronews.com/2025/07/20/cyprus-marks-51-years-since-turkish-invasion-that-led-to-island-nations-partition).

## Failed Reunification Efforts

Numerous attempts to reunify Cyprus have failed:

[The most comprehensive effort was the 2004 Annan Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_problem), which proposed a bicommunal federation with the north controlling 28.5% and the south 71.5% of territory. [Turkish Cypriots approved the plan in a referendum, but Greek Cypriots overwhelmingly rejected it (76% voted no)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus), influenced by their leadership and the Orthodox Church.

The plan's failure was partly due to property issues—[Greek Cypriots owned approximately 70% of land in what became the north](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_problem), and the plan's compensation mechanisms were deemed inadequate. Security concerns about continued Turkish troop presence also weighed heavily.

[Negotiations have continued intermittently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_problem), including talks in 2008 that reopened Ledra Street crossing through Nicosia. [Recent talks in 2024 concluded without resolving key disputes](https://www.euronews.com/2025/07/20/cyprus-marks-51-years-since-turkish-invasion-that-led-to-island-nations-partition).

## Contemporary Realities

Today, Cyprus presents stark contrasts. The Republic of Cyprus in the south is a prosperous EU member with a GDP per capita exceeding many European nations. The north remains internationally isolated, economically dependent on Turkey, and [has experienced significant demographic change through settlement of mainland Turks](https://www.gov.cy/mfa/en/documents/turkish-military-invasion-and-occupation/).

[Several crossing points now allow limited movement across the Green Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_problem), and some Greek Cypriots visit their former homes in the north. However, fundamental issues remain unresolved:

- Turkish military presence and security guarantees
- Property rights and compensation for displaced persons
- Political equality versus proportional representation
- The right of return for refugees
- Territorial adjustments

The human dimension persists. Elderly Greek Cypriots still keep keys to homes they fled in 1974. Turkish Cypriots in the north face economic challenges and international isolation. Families remain divided by the Green Line.

## Conclusion

Cyprus's history is one of continuous foreign domination punctuated by brief periods of autonomy. From ancient Assyrians and Persians to medieval Crusaders and Venetians, from three centuries of Ottoman rule to British colonialism, the island has rarely controlled its own destiny.

The tragic irony is that independence in 1960 did not bring peace. Instead, competing nationalisms—Greek Cypriot enosis and Turkish Cypriot taksim—destroyed the fragile constitutional framework. The 1974 events crystallized the division, creating a situation that has persisted for over five decades.

Understanding Cyprus today requires recognizing how this history shaped current realities: the deep-seated fears and grievances on both sides, the complexity of property and security issues, and the involvement of multiple external powers (Greece, Turkey, Britain, the UN, the EU). The island remains a frozen conflict—not actively at war, but far from peace.

Whether reunification will ever occur remains uncertain. What is certain is that thousands of years of history—from Bronze Age copper traders to Mycenaean Greeks, from Byzantine Christians to Ottoman Muslims, from British colonials to modern Cypriots—have created a unique Mediterranean crossroads that continues to struggle with questions of identity, sovereignty, and coexistence.
