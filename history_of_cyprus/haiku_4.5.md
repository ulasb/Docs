# A Brief History of Cyprus

## Geographic Location and Early Settlement

Cyprus is an island in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, located south of Turkey and west of Syria. [The island is the third-largest in the Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus) and has been strategically important for thousands of years due to its position along major trade routes.

The earliest evidence of human settlement on Cyprus dates to around 8000 BCE. [Early settlers likely arrived from the Levant (modern-day Syria and Lebanon)](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cyprus), and the island developed its own distinct Cypriot culture over millennia, though it was influenced by nearby civilizations including the Minoans and Mycenaeans.

## Periods of Foreign Rule

### Ancient and Classical Periods
Cyprus experienced a long succession of foreign rulers. [The Phoenicians, Assyrians, and Egyptians all controlled portions of the island at different times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Cyprus). In 333 BCE, Alexander the Great conquered Cyprus during his campaigns to expand the Greek empire. After Alexander's death, the island fell under the control of the Ptolemaic Dynasty of Egypt for about 250 years.

### Roman and Byzantine Rule
[In 58 BCE, Cyprus became part of the Roman Empire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cyprus/History), and it remained so for nearly 700 years. Following the division of the Roman Empire, Cyprus became part of the Byzantine Empire, which ruled for about 800 years. During this period, the island developed a strong Christian culture and identity that persists today.

### Arab-Byzantine Conflict
From the 7th to 10th centuries, [Cyprus was caught in conflict between the Byzantine Empire and Arab forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Cyprus), leading to a unique arrangement where the island was jointly administered and both powers collected taxes.

### Frankish and Venetian Rule
[Following the Crusades, the Frankish Lusignan family ruled Cyprus from 1192 to 1489](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusignan_dynasty). This period introduced Catholic Christianity and Western feudal structures to the island, creating religious divisions that would have lasting effects. [The Venetians then controlled Cyprus from 1489 to 1570](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cyprus/History).

## Ottoman Period

[In 1570, Cyprus came under Ottoman control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_Turks), which would last for over 300 years. The Ottoman rule brought administrative changes and introduced a significant Turkish Muslim population to the island, as many Turkish settlers migrated there. By the end of Ottoman rule, the island had both a Greek Christian majority and a Turkish Muslim minority—a demographic composition that would shape modern Cypriot history.

## British Colonial Rule

[Following the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878), Cyprus was ceded to British administration under the Cyprus Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_Convention,_1878). Britain formally annexed the island in 1914 when the Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the opposing side.

British rule lasted 82 years (1878-1960). During this period, Greek Cypriots increasingly sought union with Greece (known as "Enosis"), while Turkish Cypriots preferred the status quo or partition. [A Greek Cypriot armed rebellion broke out in 1955, lasting until 1959](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cyprus/History), creating significant communal tensions.

## Independence and Division

[Cyprus gained independence from Britain on August 16, 1960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus), with Archbishop Makarios III as its first president. However, the independence constitution proved unworkable due to disagreements between Greek and Turkish Cypriots over power-sharing arrangements.

Intercommunal violence erupted in December 1963, and [in 1964, the United Nations deployed a peacekeeping force (UNFICYP) to prevent further conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Peacekeeping_Force_in_Cyprus). This force remains on the island today.

### The 1974 Crisis and Partition

The situation deteriorated dramatically in 1974. [A military coup backed by the Greek junta attempted to unite Cyprus with Greece on July 15, 1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus). [In response, Turkey invaded Cyprus on July 20, 1974, citing its right to protect Turkish Cypriots](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cyprus/History).

The Turkish military operation resulted in:
- Displacement of approximately 180,000 Greek Cypriots from the north and 45,000 Turkish Cypriots from the south
- Turkish military control of the northern 36% of the island
- The establishment of a demilitarized buffer zone patrolled by UN forces

In 1983, [the Turkish Cypriot community declared the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus). The Republic of Cyprus (the internationally recognized government) controls the southern two-thirds of the island and is a member of the European Union.

## Contemporary Cyprus

Today, Cyprus remains [the world's longest-divided island capital, with Nicosia split between the two communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicosia). The UN buffer zone still divides the island after more than 50 years.

[The Republic of Cyprus joined the European Union in 2004](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cyprus) and adopted the Euro in 2008, becoming a modern, developed economy. However, the island's political status remains unresolved, with various reunification negotiations taking place over the decades, most recently in 2017.

The division reflects deeper historical patterns: centuries of foreign rule created competing cultural identities and interests that were further complicated by the island's strategic location and the geopolitical interests of larger powers. Understanding this history is essential to understanding modern Cyprus and the Mediterranean region.
