# **Cyprus: A Historical Overview of a Divided Island**

## **Introduction: The "Unsinkable Aircraft Carrier"**

Cyprus is the third-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, located at a strategic geopolitical crossroads between Europe, Asia, and Africa. To the modern observer, Cyprus is an anomaly: an island divided by a militarized "Green Line," with two distinct governments operating on a landmass smaller than Connecticut.

To understand the current division, one must look at its history as a strategic asset for major powers.

**1\. The Roots of Diversity (1571–1878)**

While Cyprus has a history stretching back to the Mycenaean Greeks (approx. 1400 BC), the demographic roots of the current conflict were established during the Ottoman Empire.

In **1571**, the Ottoman Empire conquered Cyprus from the Venetians.

* **Demographic Shift:** The Ottomans settled approximately 30,000 Turkish soldiers and their families on the island. This created the distinct Turkish Cypriot community living alongside the Greek Cypriot majority.  
* **The Millet System:** The Ottomans governed through the "Millet" system, which classified citizens by religion rather than ethnicity. This allowed the Greek Orthodox Church to manage the affairs of the Greek population, reinforcing a separate identity from the Muslim Turkish population.

**2\. British Rule and Rising Nationalism (1878–1960)**

In **1878**, the Ottoman Empire leased Cyprus to Great Britain in exchange for protection against Russia. Britain formally annexed the island during World War I.

During British administration, two opposing nationalisms solidified, fueled by the education systems and religious leadership of each community:

1. **Enosis (Union):** The Greek Cypriot desire for political union with "Motherland" Greece.  
2. **Taksim (Partition):** The Turkish Cypriot counter-desire to partition the island, fearing that *Enosis* would lead to their persecution as a minority.

In the 1950s, the Greek Cypriot militia **EOKA** launched an armed anti-colonial struggle against the British to achieve *Enosis*. In response, Turkish Cypriots formed the **TMT** resistance organization. The violence moved from anti-British to inter-communal.

**3\. The Compromise of Independence (1960)**

Unable to contain the violence, Britain negotiated a solution with Greece and Turkey. In **1960**, the **Republic of Cyprus** was born. It was a compromise that neither side truly wanted: independence instead of *Enosis* or *Taksim*.

### **The Unique Constitution**

The 1960 Constitution was designed to protect the Turkish Cypriot minority (18% of the population) against the Greek Cypriot majority (78%).

* **Power Sharing:** A Greek Cypriot President (Archbishop Makarios III) and a Turkish Cypriot Vice President (Dr. Fazıl Küçük), each with veto power.  
* **The Treaty of Guarantee:** A critical legal instrument signed by **Britain, Greece, and Turkey**. It gave these three "Guarantor Powers" the right to intervene militarily to re-establish the state of affairs if the constitutional order was threatened.

### **The Breakdown (1963)**

By **1963**, the power-sharing arrangement collapsed. President Makarios proposed 13 amendments to the constitution, which Turkish Cypriots viewed as a removal of their protections. Violence erupted (an event known as "Bloody Christmas"). Turkish Cypriots withdrew from the government and moved into isolated, fortified enclaves.

In **1964**, the **UNFICYP** (United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus) was established to patrol the lines between the communities. They remain on the island today.

**4\. The Crisis of 1974**

The defining moment of modern Cypriot history occurred in the summer of 1974\.

### **The Coup (July 15, 1974\)**

The military junta ruling Greece at the time backed a coup d'état in Cyprus. They overthrew President Makarios and installed a pro-Enosis nationalist, Nicos Sampson. The coup was widely viewed as a direct step toward immediate annexation by Greece.

### **The Invasion (July 20, 1974\)**

Citing the **Treaty of Guarantee** and the safety of the Turkish Cypriot minority, Turkey launched a military invasion ("Operation Attila").

* The Turkish military quickly seized the northern 37% of the island.  
* **The Result:** The island was physically bisected. Approximately 160,000 Greek Cypriots fled south, and 45,000 Turkish Cypriots moved north.

**5\. The Status Quo (1974–Present)**

Since 1974, the island has remained divided by a Buffer Zone (the "Green Line") patrolled by the UN.

* **1983 Declaration:** The Turkish-controlled north declared independence as the **Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC)**.  
  * *Fact:* To this day, the TRNC is recognized *only* by Turkey. The rest of the world considers it occupied territory of the Republic of Cyprus.  
* **2004 The Annan Plan:** The UN proposed a reunification plan. It was put to a referendum.  
  * Turkish Cypriots voted **Yes** (65%).  
  * Greek Cypriots voted **No** (76%), citing security concerns and property disputes.  
* **EU Accession (2004):** A week after the failed referendum, the Republic of Cyprus joined the **European Union**.  
  * *Legal anomaly:* The entire island is technically in the EU, but EU laws are "suspended" in the north until a settlement is reached.

### **Where We Are Today**

* **Governance:** The South is an internationally recognized EU state; the North acts as a separate state heavily dependent on Turkey for economic and military support.  
* **Border Crossings:** Since 2003, checkpoints have opened, allowing civilians to cross the border for day trips, easing tensions but not solving the political deadlock.  
* **Key Obstacles:** Negotiations frequently stall over the presence of Turkish troops, rights to offshore natural gas, and the "Right of Return" for refugees who lost property in 1974\.
