Goal:
We want to create a document explaning to the engineers in our organization how they would benefit from leveraging LLMs in their day to day work.

Important points to cover:
- Without LLMs in your workflows you are likely being not nearly as effective as you could be otherwise
- LLMs of course can help things like autocompleting code, even predicting what should go into a function based on the rest of the code and the comments.
- This is not the most impactful way to use them however, among other things:
-- They can take and understand large codebases, 
-- They can help simplify or re-create from scratch, 
-- They can migrate from one language or paradigm to a more modern one
-- They can convert PRDs, take coding best practices and style guides, and produce code
- LLMs can seem risky and indeed there is a risk of hallucinations and mistakes if we don't understand what we are asking for or provide guidance to the models.
- Risk also can be mitigated via things like good tests, effective metrics, and alerts.
- If we do not use them, we are not avoiding risk - we are actually saying we are okay with taking the risk of moving slowly and being inefficient
- We have LLM best practices and examples that we will share separately.
- We are not the first ones using them, there are many success stories out here and many companies are seeing increased productivity.

Restriction on length:
- This needs to be at most 2 pages long to ensure it can be consumed easily and quickly.

Overall guidance:
- Be succinct. Avoid needless fluff.
- Add a short TL;DR section to the beginning.
- Don't worry about a references section though feel free to use hyperlinks to connect to external resources.
- The document should end with at least a few sentences on the excitement around this new toolset and the potential it has for us, urging the engineers to start using ASAP.
